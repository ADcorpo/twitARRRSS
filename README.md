# twitARRRSS
Twitter for RSS fanboys

twitARRRSS is a small script that converts twitter API endpoints to Atom feeds.

You can host it on a server if you want to allow your users to get
data from twitter without registering, or simply use it to get news
without the productivity loss that come along with an intensive
twitter usage.

## TODO

* add a twitter search endpoint
* find ideas to ease the use of twitARRRSS as a monitoring/community management tool

## Side notes

This is my first try with flask, if I made mistakes, please tell me o/
